Regular expressions are often used to perform this sanitization. However, when the regular expression matches multiple consecutive characters, replacing it just once can result in the unsafe text reappearing in the sanitized input.\n\nAttackers can exploit this issue by crafting inputs that, when sanitized with an ineffective regular expression, still contain malicious code or content. This can lead to code execution, data exposure, or other vulnerabilities.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo prevent this issue, it is highly recommended to use a well-tested sanitization library whenever possible. These libraries are more likely to handle corner cases and ensure effective sanitization.\n\nIf a library is not an option, you can consider alternative strategies to fix the issue. For example, applying the regular expression replacement repeatedly until no more replacements can be performed, or rewriting the regular expression to match single characters instead of the entire unsafe text.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider the following JavaScript code that aims to remove all HTML comment start and end tags:\n\n```javascript\n\nstr.replace(/<!--|--!?>/g, \"\");   \n\n```\nGiven the input string \"&lt;!&lt;!--- comment ---&gt;&gt;\", the output will be \"&lt;!-- comment --&gt;\", which still contains an HTML comment.\n\nOne possible fix for this issue is to apply the regular expression replacement repeatedly until no more replacements can be performed. This ensures that the unsafe text does not re-appear in the sanitized input, effectively removing all instances of the targeted pattern:\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction removeHtmlComments(input) {  \n  let previous;  \n  do {  \n    previous = input;  \n    input = input.replace(/<!--|--!?>/g, \"\");  \n  } while (input !== previous);  \n  return input;  \n}  \n\n```\n\n## Example\nAnother example is the following regular expression intended to remove script tags:\n\n```javascript\n\nstr.replace(/<script\\b[^<]*(?:(?!<\\/script>)<[^<]*)*<\\/script>/g, \"\");  \n\n```\nIf the input string is \"&lt;scrip&lt;script&gt;is removed&lt;/script&gt;t&gt;alert(123)&lt;/script&gt;\", the output will be \"&lt;script&gt;alert(123)&lt;/script&gt;\", which still contains a script tag.\n\nA fix for this issue is to rewrite the regular expression to match single characters (\"&lt;\" and \"&gt;\") instead of the entire unsafe text. This simplifies the sanitization process and ensures that all potentially unsafe characters are removed:\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction removeAllHtmlTags(input) {  \n  return input.replace(/<|>/g, \"\");  \n}\n\n```\nAnother potential fix is to use the popular `sanitize-html` npm library. It keeps most of the safe HTML tags while removing all unsafe tags and attributes.\n\n```javascript\n\nconst sanitizeHtml = require(\"sanitize-html\");\nfunction removeAllHtmlTags(input) {  \n  return sanitizeHtml(input);  \n}\n\n```\n\n## Example\nLastly, consider a path sanitizer using the regular expression `/\\.\\.\\//`:\n\n```javascript\n\nstr.replace(/\\.\\.\\//g, \"\");  \n\n```\nThe regular expression attempts to strip out all occurences of `/../` from `str`. This will not work as expected: for the string `/./.././`, for example, it will remove the single occurrence of `/../` in the middle, but the remainder of the string then becomes `/../`, which is another instance of the substring we were trying to remove.\n\nA possible fix for this issue is to use the \"sanitize-filename\" npm library for path sanitization. This library is specifically designed to handle path sanitization, and should handle all corner cases and ensure effective sanitization:\n\n```javascript\n\nconst sanitize = require(\"sanitize-filename\");  \n  \nfunction sanitizePath(input) {  \n  return sanitize(input);  \n}  \n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP Top 10: [A1 Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection).\n* Stack Overflow: [Removing all script tags from HTML with JS regular expression](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6659351/removing-all-script-tags-from-html-with-js-regular-expression).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-80](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.19.3"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/develop","analysis_key":".github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml:analyze","environment":"{\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\"}","category":".github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml:analyze/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"e66928e9ad2742c16037ac97308e0f5ee6c7943c","message":{"text":"This string may still contain <style, which may cause an HTML element injection vulnerability."},"location":{"path":"www/postcss.config.cjs","start_line":10,"end_line":10,"start_column":45,"end_column":90},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Dossier-Facile-Frontend/code-scanning/alerts/22/instances"}]}]}
