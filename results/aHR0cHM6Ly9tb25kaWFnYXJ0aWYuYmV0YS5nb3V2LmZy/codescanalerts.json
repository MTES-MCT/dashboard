Whenever that error message occurs for an end user, the developer can use the stack trace to help identify how to fix the problem. In particular, stack traces can tell the developer more about the sequence of events that led to a failure, as opposed to merely the final state of the software when the error occurred.\n\nUnfortunately, the same information can be useful to an attacker. The sequence of class names in a stack trace can reveal the structure of the application as well as any internal components it relies on. Furthermore, the error message at the top of a stack trace can include information such as server-side file names and SQL code that the application relies on, allowing an attacker to fine-tune a subsequent injection attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nSend the user a more generic error message that reveals less information. Either suppress the stack trace entirely, or log it only on the server.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an exception is handled in two different ways. In the first version, labeled BAD, the exception is sent back to the remote user by returning it from the function. As such, the user is able to see a detailed stack trace, which may contain sensitive information. In the second version, the error message is logged only on the server, and a generic error message is displayed to the user. That way, the developers can still access and use the error log, but remote users will not see the information.\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n\nimport traceback\n\ndef do_computation():\n    raise Exception(\"Secret info\")\n\n# BAD\n@app.route('/bad')\ndef server_bad():\n    try:\n        do_computation()\n    except Exception as e:\n        return traceback.format_exc()\n\n# GOOD\n@app.route('/good')\ndef server_good():\n    try:\n        do_computation()\n    except Exception as e:\n        log(traceback.format_exc())\n        return \"An internal error has occurred!\"\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-209](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-497](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/497.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.19.1"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:python\",\"language\":\"python\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:python","state":"open","commit_sha":"ce8a9ba86b023f1e06e4784613fab7fcea5777a5","message":{"text":"Stack trace information flows to this location and may be exposed to an external user."},"location":{"path":"public_data/views.py","start_line":150,"end_line":150,"start_column":29,"end_column":37},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/sparte/code-scanning/alerts/26/instances"},{"number":25,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:13:30Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T07:13:31Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/sparte/code-scanning/alerts/25","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/sparte/security/code-scanning/25","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"py/url-redirection","severity":"error","description":"URL redirection from remote source","name":"py/url-redirection","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-601","security"],"full_description":"URL redirection based on unvalidated user input may cause redirection to malicious web sites.","help":"# URL redirection from remote source\nDirectly incorporating user input into a URL redirect request without validating the input can facilitate phishing attacks. In these attacks, unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled by the attacker.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against untrusted URL redirection, it is advisable to avoid putting user input directly into a redirect URL. Instead, maintain a list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list based on the user input provided.\n\nIf this is not possible, then the user input should be validated in some other way, for example, by verifying that the target URL does not include an explicit host name.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a URL redirect without validating the input, which facilitates phishing attacks:\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    return redirect(target, code=302)\n\n```\nIf you know the set of valid redirect targets, you can maintain a list of them on the server and check that the user input is in that list:\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\n\nVALID_REDIRECT = \"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html\"\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    if target == VALID_REDIRECT:\n        return redirect(target, code=302)\n    else:\n        # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n        return redirect('/', code=302)\n\n```\nOften this is not possible, so an alternative is to check that the target URL does not specify an explicit host name. For example, you can use the `urlparse` function from the Python standard library to parse the URL and check that the `netloc` attribute is empty.\n\nNote, however, that some cases are not handled as we desire out-of-the-box by `urlparse`, so we need to adjust two things, as shown in the example below:\n\n* Many browsers accept backslash characters (`\\`) as equivalent to forward slash characters (`/`) in URLs, but the `urlparse` function does not.\n* Mistyped URLs such as `https:/example.com` or `https:///example.com` are parsed as having an empty `netloc` attribute, while browsers will still redirect to the correct site.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    target = target.replace('\\\\', '')\n    if not urlparse(target).netloc and not urlparse(target).scheme:\n        # relative path, safe to redirect\n        return redirect(target, code=302)\n    # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n    return redirect('/', code=302)\n\n```\nFor Django application, you can use the function `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` to check that a URL is safe to redirect to, as shown in the following example:\n\n\n```python\nfrom django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\nfrom django.shortcuts import redirect\nfrom django.utils.http import url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme\nfrom django.views import View\n\nclass RedirectView(View):\n    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n        target = request.GET.get('target', '')\n        if url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme(target, allowed_hosts=None):\n            return HttpResponseRedirect(target)\n        else:\n            # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n            return redirect('/')\n```\nNote that `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` handles backslashes correctly, so no additional processing is required.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [ XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Python standard library: [ urllib.parse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.19.1"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:python\",\"language\":\"python\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:python","state":"open","commit_sha":"ce8a9ba86b023f1e06e4784613fab7fcea5777a5","message":{"text":"Untrusted URL redirection depends on a user-provided value."},"location":{"path":"users/views.py","start_line":46,"end_line":46,"start_column":37,"end_column":59},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/sparte/code-scanning/alerts/25/instances"},{"number":24,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:13:30Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T07:13:31Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/sparte/code-scanning/alerts/24","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/sparte/security/code-scanning/24","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"py/url-redirection","severity":"error","description":"URL redirection from remote source","name":"py/url-redirection","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-601","security"],"full_description":"URL redirection based on unvalidated user input may cause redirection to malicious web sites.","help":"# URL redirection from remote source\nDirectly incorporating user input into a URL redirect request without validating the input can facilitate phishing attacks.

Instead, maintain a list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list based on the user input provided.\n\nIf this is not possible, then the user input should be validated in some other way, for example, by verifying that the target URL does not include an explicit host name.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a URL redirect without validating the input, which facilitates phishing attacks:\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    return redirect(target, code=302)\n\n```\nIf you know the set of valid redirect targets, you can maintain a list of them on the server and check that the user input is in that list:\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\n\nVALID_REDIRECT = \"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html\"\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    if target == VALID_REDIRECT:\n        return redirect(target, code=302)\n    else:\n        # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n        return redirect('/', code=302)\n\n```\nOften this is not possible, so an alternative is to check that the target URL does not specify an explicit host name. For example, you can use the `urlparse` function from the Python standard library to parse the URL and check that the `netloc` attribute is empty.\n\nNote, however, that some cases are not handled as we desire out-of-the-box by `urlparse`, so we need to adjust two things, as shown in the example below:\n\n* Many browsers accept backslash characters (`\\`) as equivalent to forward slash characters (`/`) in URLs, but the `urlparse` function does not.\n* Mistyped URLs such as `https:/example.com` or `https:///example.com` are parsed as having an empty `netloc` attribute, while browsers will still redirect to the correct site.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    target = target.replace('\\\\', '')\n    if not urlparse(target).netloc and not urlparse(target).scheme:\n        # relative path, safe to redirect\n        return redirect(target, code=302)\n    # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n    return redirect('/', code=302)\n\n```\nFor Django application, you can use the function `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` to check that a URL is safe to redirect to, as shown in the following example:\n\n\n```python\nfrom django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\nfrom django.shortcuts import redirect\nfrom django.utils.http import url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme\nfrom django.views import View\n\nclass RedirectView(View):\n    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n        target = request.GET.get('target', '')\n        if url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme(target, allowed_hosts=None):\n            return HttpResponseRedirect(target)\n        else:\n            # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n            return redirect('/')\n```\nNote that `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` handles backslashes correctly, so no additional processing is required.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [ XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Python standard library: [ urllib.parse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.19.1"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:python\",\"language\":\"python\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:python","state":"open","commit_sha":"ce8a9ba86b023f1e06e4784613fab7fcea5777a5","message":{"text":"Untrusted URL redirection depends on a user-provided value.\nUntrusted URL redirection depends on a user-provided value.\nUntrusted URL redirection depends on a user-provided value."},"location":{"path":"project/views/crud.py","start_line":221,"end_line":221,"start_column":45,"end_column":67},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/sparte/code-scanning/alerts/21/instances"},{"number":20,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:13:17Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T07:13:19Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/sparte/code-scanning/alerts/20","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/sparte/security/code-scanning/20","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/incomplete-sanitization","severity":"warning","description":"Incomplete string escaping or encoding","name":"js/incomplete-sanitization","tags":["correctness","external/cwe/cwe-020","external/cwe/cwe-080","external/cwe/cwe-116","security"],"full_description":"A string transformer that does not replace or escape all occurrences of a meta-character may be ineffective.","help":"# Incomplete string escaping or encoding\nSanitizing untrusted input is a common technique for preventing injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

Usually, this is done by escaping meta-characters such as quotes in a domain-specific way so that they are treated as normal characters.\n\nHowever, directly using the string `replace` method to perform escaping is notoriously error-prone. Common mistakes include only replacing the first occurrence of a meta-character, or backslash-escaping various meta-characters but not the backslash itself.\n\nIn the former case, later meta-characters are left undisturbed and can be used to subvert the sanitization. In the latter case, preceding a meta-character with a backslash leads to the backslash being escaped, but the meta-character appearing un-escaped, which again makes the sanitization ineffective.\n\nEven if the escaped string is not used in a security-critical context, incomplete escaping may still have undesirable effects, such as badly rendered or confusing output.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a (well-tested) sanitization library if at all possible. These libraries are much more likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using prepared statements for SQL queries.\n\nOtherwise, make sure to use a regular expression with the `g` flag to ensure that all occurrences are replaced, and remember to escape backslashes if applicable.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, assume that we want to embed a user-controlled string `accountNumber` into a SQL query as part of a string literal.

The sequence is not truly random because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values, the seed. If the random number generator is cryptographically weak, then this sequence may be easily predictable through outside observations.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator if the output is to be used in a security-sensitive context. As a rule of thumb, a value should be considered \"security-sensitive\" if predicting it would allow the attacker to perform an action that they would otherwise be unable to perform. For example, if an attacker could predict the random password generated for a new user, they would be able to log in as that new user.\n\nFor JavaScript on the NodeJS platform, `crypto.getRandomBytes` provides a cryptographically secure pseudo-random byte generator. Note that the conversion from bytes to numbers can introduce bias that breaks the security.\n\nFor JavaScript in the browser, `crypto.getRandomValues` provides a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following examples show different ways of generating a password.\n\nIn the first case, we generate a fresh password by appending a random integer to the end of a static string. The random number generator used (`Math.random`) is not cryptographically secure, so it may be possible for an attacker to predict the generated password.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction insecurePassword() {\n    // BAD: the random suffix is not cryptographically secure\n    var suffix = Math.random();\n    var password = \"myPassword\" + suffix;\n    return password;\n}\n\n```\nIn the second example, a cryptographically secure random number generator is used for the same purpose. In this case, it is much harder to predict the generated integers.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction securePassword() {\n    // GOOD: the random suffix is cryptographically secure\n    var suffix = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(1))[0];\n    var password = \"myPassword\" + suffix;\n    \n    // GOOD: if a random value between 0 and 1 is desired\n    var secret = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(1))[0] * Math.pow(2,-32);\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [Pseudo-random number generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator).\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [Crypto: getRandomValues()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues).\n* NodeJS: [crypto.randomBytes](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_randombytes_size_callback)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-338](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html).\n","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.19.1"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"ce8a9ba86b023f1e06e4784613fab7fcea5777a5","message":{"text":"This uses a cryptographically insecure random number generated at Math.random() in a security context."},"location":{"path":"static/assets/scripts/bundle.js","start_line":1,"end_line":1,"start_column":1487268,"end_column":1487272},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/sparte/code-scanning/alerts/13/instances"},{"number":12,"created_at":"2024-09-19T21:52:10Z","updated_at":"2024-09-19T21:52:12Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/sparte/code-scanning/alerts/12","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/sparte/security/code-scanning/12","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"docker:S7018","severity":"warning","description":"Arguments in long RUN instructions should be sorted","name":"docker:S7018","tags":[],"full_description":"Arguments in long RUN instructions should be sorted","help":"<p>In Dockerfiles, when commands within a <code>RUN</code> instruction have a lot of arguments, especially those that install system packages, it is\nimportant to ensure that the arguments are sorted alphabetically (if the order is not enforced by a command).
